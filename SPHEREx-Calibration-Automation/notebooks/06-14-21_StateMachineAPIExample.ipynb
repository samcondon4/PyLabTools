    "The state machine on its own does not execute any useful code. It simply provides a framework through which \n",
    "instrument control code can plug in through what is termed an 'action.' **An action is a collection of two pieces of data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*1) Function pointer* \\\n",
    "*2) Identifier string*\n",
    "\n",
    "When actions are added to the state-machine, we pass both of the above pieces of information to the **\\<state_machine_object\\>.add_action_to_state()** method. Actions must be assigned to an individual state-machine state, so we also pass in a string to identify which state the action should execute within. Overall the call signature for the add_action() method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\\<state_machine_object\\>.add_action_to_state(\\<state identifier string\\>, \\<action identifier string\\>, \\<action function pointer\\>)*\n",
    "\n",
    "All actions must accept a single positional argument. In the example actions below, this argument has been called 'action_dict.' When an action is called within the state-machine, it is passed a dictionary through the action_dict argument. This dictionary takes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "action_dict = {'state_machine': \\<state machine instance object\\>, 'params': \\<action parameters\\>}\n",
    "\n",
    "The state machine instance object can be used to control the state machine within actions while the action parameters define any arguments that the action needs to operate.\n"
