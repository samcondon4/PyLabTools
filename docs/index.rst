SPHERExLabTools DAQ and Instrument Control
===========================================

| SPHERExLabTools (SLT) provides a general purpose laboratory data acquisition and instrument control system with driver
  level software for control of testbed instrumentation, graphical interfaces, real-time data visualization, processing,
  data archival tools for a variety of output file formats, and mechanisms to run manual and automated measurements.
  Each component is highly configurable with minimal manual coding required by a user.

| SLT draws inspiration from the existing `PyMeasure <https://pymeasure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `PyHk <http://docs.pyhk.net/en/beta/>`_ projects.
  Many low-level architecture details are drawn directly from PyMeasure and the configuration file based interface was drawn from PyHk.
