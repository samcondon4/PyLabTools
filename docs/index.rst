Welcome to SPHERExLabTools's documentation!
===========================================

SPHERExLabTools is a general purpose data acquisition and instrument control package built in Python for use in the SPHEREx optics test and calibration campaign. The package extends the repository of instrument classes provided in the :pymeasure:`PyMeasure Project <>` and allows the specification of complex measurement procedures through sets of configuration files with only a limited amount of manual coding required by a user. 

Follow the :doc:`Installation Guide <installation>` for installation instructions, then check out :doc:`SPHERExLabTools Fundamentals <user_guide/fundamentals>` to orient yourself with the package. For instructions on running preconfigured experiments see :doc:`SPHERExLabTools Core Experiments <user_guide/core_experiments>`.
