Welcome to SPHERExLabTools's documentation!
===========================================

SPHERExLabTools is a general purpose data acquisition and instrument control package built in Python for use in the SPHEREx
optics test and calibration campaign. SPHERExLabTools (SLT) makes laboratory data acquisition and control easy. The package wraps the repository of existing
instrument drivers in the :ref:`PyMeasure <https://pymeasure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>` project, while implementing a few new
features for instrument control. SLT also provides a system for running measurement scripts, plotting live data, and archiving
data in a wide variety of file formats all with only a limited amount of manual coding required from users.

Start by following the :doc:`Installation Guide <installation>` to set up the SLT package on your system. The rest of this
documentation is structured as follows:

   - :doc:`SPHERExLabTools Fundamentals <user_guide/fundamentals>` provides a brief overview of the architecture and operating principles of the package.
   - :doc:`Tutorials <user_guide/tutorials>` provide step by step instructions for:
      - Running preconfigured "Core Experiment" control software such as for the spectral and focus calibration measurements.
      - Configuring "Custom Experiments" to generate control software for measurements not already supported as a "Core Experiment".
   - | :doc:`Core Experiments <user_guide/core_experiments>` details the components of the preconfigured control software used for the spectral
           and focus calibration measurements.
   - | :doc:`Custom Experiments <user_guide/custom_experiments>` documents in detail the syntax and structure of the configuration files
           required to generate custom instrument control software.
